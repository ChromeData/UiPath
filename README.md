# UiPath
Robotic process automation (RPA) is a technology that allows for the creation, deployment, and management of software robots that mimic human interactions with digital systems. These robots can read screens, input keystrokes, navigate systems, and extract data, performing tasks more quickly and consistently than humans without breaks.

# Building 5 Bots to Automate tasks on UiPATH + Azure Lab


## Weather Automation Workflow - Bot #1
This UiPath project automates the process of fetching weather information for any given city. It begins by prompting the user to enter a city name, then searches for the current weather on Google, and logs both the temperature and weather conditions. The workflow efficiently retrieves and displays relevant weather details using simple user interactions.

Summary:
This workflow automates the process of fetching and logging weather details from Google based on a user-specified city. It demonstrates various UiPath activities like input handling, browser automation, data extraction, and logging. This sequence is particularly useful for learning about UiPath's capabilities in integrating web-based data extraction into automation workflows.



## UiPath Web Data Handling Workflow - Bot #2
This repository contains a UiPath workflow designed to automate the process of data extraction from a web application, specifically from a CRM-like system. The automation sequence involves reading customer data from an Excel file, inputting this data into a web form, and managing the customer information effectively within the application.

This UiPath workflow demonstrates an automation process for extracting and handling data from a excel sheet to be entered in a web application.

1. **Read Customer Data from Excel:** The workflow starts by reading customer data stored in an Excel file into a DataTable, which is then processed in subsequent steps.

2. **Open Browser and Navigate to CRM:** A web browser is opened, and the workflow navigates to the CRM system where customer data will be managed.

3. **Data Entry Automation:**
   - For each customer (row in the DataTable), the workflow performs the following actions:
     - Input the customer's first and last names into the corresponding fields in the web form.
     - Depending on the gender specified in the Excel file, the workflow selects the appropriate gender option in the form.
     - Other customer details such as address, city, and contact information are also entered into the form.

4. **Submit Customer Data:** After all fields are filled, the workflow clicks the 'Add' button to submit the data, thereby creating or updating a customer record in the CRM.

5. **Error Handling and Logging:** Throughout the execution, the workflow includes error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure robust automation and ease of troubleshooting.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- UiPath Studio for workflow design and execution.
- Excel for storing initial customer data.
- Web-based CRM system for customer data management.

**Purpose and Benefits:**
- Automates repetitive data entry tasks, reducing manual effort and error rates.
- Enhances data processing speed and accuracy in customer relationship management.


## Real Estate Web Scraping - Bot #3
A user enters a city name, the robot then scrapes thousands of real estate listing data in that city off the web. The data is then exported into a MS Excel spreadsheet, including the prices of the property, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and suburb location.

### **1. Main Sequence**
- **Step:** The main sequence initiates the workflow, setting up any necessary variables or configurations, such as the search parameters for properties on Zillow.

### **2. Open Browser and Navigate to Zillow**
- **Step:** The workflow opens a browser and navigates to Zillow.com. This step is essential to start the property search process on the Zillow website.

### **3. Input Property Search Criteria**
- **Step:** The bot locates the search field on Zillowâ€™s homepage and inputs specific criteria, such as a city, neighborhood, or zip code. This could also include filters like price range, number of bedrooms, or property type.

### **4. Click Search Button**
- **Step:** After entering the search criteria, the bot simulates a click on Zillow's "Search" button to retrieve a list of properties that match the entered criteria.

### **5. Interact with Property Listings**
- **Step:** The workflow processes the search results by clicking on a particular property listing, scrolling through the results, or filtering the listings further based on additional criteria (e.g., price, size, etc.).

### **6. Extract or Read Property Information**
- **Step:** The bot extracts specific information from the selected property listing, such as the address, price, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and any other relevant details. This information might be stored in a file or used for further processing.

### **7. Click Additional Buttons or Links (e.g., Schedule a Tour)**
- **Step:** The bot interacts with additional buttons or links on the property listing page, such as scheduling a tour, contacting the real estate agent, or saving the property to a favorites list.

### **8. Handle Pop-ups or Additional Pages (e.g., Sign-in or Registration)**
- **Step:** If Zillow prompts a sign-in or registration pop-up, or if additional pages open, the bot will handle these by either logging in, filling out forms, or dismissing the pop-ups as needed.

### **9. End Process or Close Browser**
- **Step:** The final steps in the sequence involve ending the process cleanly by saving any extracted data, logging out if necessary, and closing the browser.

### **Summary**
This UiPath workflow is designed to automate a series of tasks on Zillow.com, from searching for properties based on specific criteria, interacting with the search results, extracting relevant property details, to handling any additional tasks like logging in or closing pop-ups. This bot allows users to efficiently gather property information without manual effort, making the property search process much quicker and more streamlined.
